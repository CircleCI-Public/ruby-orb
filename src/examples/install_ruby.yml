  For environments where Ruby is not pre-installed. (Recommended: It is faster and more deterministic to use a Docker image with Ruby pre-installed. Installing Ruby at run-time is not advised unless required.)
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    ruby: circleci/ruby@x.y #Ensure you are using the latest version of the orb
  jobs:
    build:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/base:stable # This image does not contain Ruby
      steps:
        - checkout
        - ruby/install:
            version: "2.7" # optionally specify a version
        - run: echo "Ruby 2.7 has been installed"
